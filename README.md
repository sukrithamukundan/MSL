Malayalam Sign Language Recognision

The National Institute of Speech and Hearing (NISH) has come up with uniform sign language characters in the Malayalam alphabet using finger-spelling on September 29, . Teachers and students at NISH, under the supervision of sign language experts there, have come up with the finger-spelling, which covers vowels and consonants too. This new sign language alphabet in Malayalam will eliminate the challenge of teachers in conveying messages through lip movement. This would also help bring about a qualitative change in the lives of those who are hearing impaired.


This project aims at introducing a mobile application that recognizes these Malayalam sign alphabets with the help of machine learning technology. Since these Malayalam Sign Alphabets are new, there was no proper dataset for this system. So the creation of a dataset for Malayalam Sign Alphabets is also an objective of our project.
